# How do I know what something does?
Starting with Android 8 you can long press almost every clickable element without a label to see what it will do.
---
# My API key is invalid.
Tap CREATE KEY to open the key management page of your Grocy instance.
Create a new key and copy it to your clipboard, then paste it in the key field of Grocy Android and try again.

If you use Hass.io with the Grocy Add-on, read the next section.

# How can I use this app with Hass.io?
In the Supervisor of Hass.io, open the Configuration tab of the Grocy Add-on.
Change the host port (which will be exposed) from "null" to any other number like "40" (without the quotes) in the Network section.
Now in this app here in the field "Server URL", enter the domain or IP address of your Hass.io server together with ":<chosen port>".
So the Server URL can look like this:

- http://192.168.178.123:40
- https://myhassioserver.com:40

Attention! If your Hass.io server is publicly accessible, following points are important for you:

- Make sure that you have set up a working HTTPS certificate in the Configuration section of the Grocy Add-on.
- Start the URL with "https://" like above.
- Don't forget to set a strong password for all users in Grocy (default is "admin"), because anyone has now access to your Grocy instance and it is not protected by Hass.io login anymore.
