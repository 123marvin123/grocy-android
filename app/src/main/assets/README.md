# TODO

## Features
- open food facts implementation for product naming with barcode
- help page with note that all buttons can be long pressed to get a tip
- translation contribution
- open new issue in feedback bottom sheet
- Batch consume: icon action for opening product
- create and edit shopping lists
- extended product edit
- Master product group sheet: go to master products with this product filter applied

## Improvements
- use server settings and configs
- shorter tags & ids for master edit
- Shopping list: make bottom notes clickable
- Always show bottom app bar on new fragment or on back press
- app setting instead of server config for shopping list indicator?

## Bugs

- shopping list doesn't show items without name & desc., but shows items with only description?
- bottom menu and fab not clickable after back press from Purchase
- don't let red warning from demo blink up on non-demo start
- crash on batch activity after press back from "product edit" or "add to shopping list"
- sort product groups and locations in filter menu alphabetically (stock and master products)
