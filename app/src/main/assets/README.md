# TODO

## Features
- add and edit shopping lists and shopping list entries
- scanning: indicate type (consume or purchase) and maybe allow switching
- app shortcut: new shopping list entry
- maybe open food facts implementation for product naming with barcode
- HELP page with note that all buttons can be long pressed to get a tip
- translations

## Improvements
- api: inner classes for categories
- hide `<br>` in product description
- use server settings and configs
- shorter tags & ids for master edit
- id naming convention: `frame_back_...` to `frame_..._back`, same with close and `linear_app_bar_..._default` to `linear_..._app_bar_default`
- shopping list doesn't show items without name & description, but it shows items with only description?
- average shelf life is empty in product overview when expired
- fix color contrast of retro colors with text: [contast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- better reachable ABOUT
- Github page in ABOUT and thanks to grocy author
