Grocy Android uses grocy's official API to provide you a beautiful interface on your smartphone with powerful barcode scanning and intuitive batch processing, all what you need to efficiently manage your groceries.

**This app requires a running self-hosted instance of the [grocy server application](https://grocy.info/). You can try it using the demo option available on the login screen.**
