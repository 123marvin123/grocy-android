Grocy is a self-hosted groceries and household management solution for your home. Go to grocy.info for more information about the project.

Grocy for Android uses Grocy's official API to provide you a beautiful interface on your phone with powerful barcode scanning and intuitive batch processing, all what you need to efficiently manage your groceries.

<b>This app requires a running self-hosted instance of the grocy server application. It is a companion app, therefore it cannot run standalone or manage products itself!

<b>Contribution:</b>
If you run into a bug or miss a feature, feel free to give feedback in the app, send us an email or <a href="https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android/issues/new">open an issue on GitHub</a>.
Like the grocy project, Grocy Android can be translated, too. Please go to our GitHub page for more information.

<b>Compatibility:</b>
Grocy Android requires at least grocy 2.7.0 on your server.
It is also possible to use the grocy Add-on on a Hass.io server. Our in-app help explains how to do that.

Self-signed certificates are not supported at the moment. Right now, the server certificate has to be signed by a certificate authority (CA). This CA has to be public and trusted by Android.
To meet these requirements, you can use a free certificate from letsencrypt.org for proper https encryption.

We'd like to thank the developer of Grocy, Bernd Bestel, without whose great work this app would never have been possible.
