<p><br><b>Contribution:</b></p>
<p>If you run into a bug or miss a feature, feel free to give feedback in the app, send us an email or <a href="https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android/issues">open an issue on GitHub</a>. Like the grocy project, Grocy Android can be translated, too. Please go to our GitHub page for more information.</p>

<p><br><b>Compatibility:</b></p>
<p>Grocy Android requires at least grocy 2.7.0 on your server. It is also possible to use the grocy Add-on on a Hass.io server. Our in-app help explains how to do that.</p>
<p><br>We'd like to thank the developer of Grocy, Bernd Bestel, without whose great work this app would never have been possible.</p>
